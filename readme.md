# Data Structures and Algorithms

**Algorithms** and **Data Structures** are fundamental concepts in computer science used to solve problems efficiently.

**Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving a specific problem.
They define the logic of how tasks are performed, such as sorting numbers, searching in a database, or finding the shortest path between points.

**Data Structures** are ways to organize and store data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables.
